Overview
------------

This project contains 2 parts:

1. it is a crawler which collects phonenumbers from several forum threads which contain blacklisted phones.
2. it is a site which allows to search phonenumbers

Why
------------
People write phone numbers in very different formats, like +7-xxx-xxx-xx-xx, 8(xxx)xxxxxxx, etc. As result it is usually
hard to check phone number by search - Google and Yandes do not help to check different phone number formats.

This site recognize different formats and allows to search phones in any of them.
